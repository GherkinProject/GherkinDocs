Welcome to Gherkin Project.
This is the machine learning section to analyse audio file loaded by your server.

### Requirements

1. R
with the packages:
 - cluster
 - kernlab
 - rgl
 - FactoMineR
 - more?
Reminder: to install R packages
  
  > install.packages('myPackageName')

2. Python (>= 2.5)

3. Gherkin Server

4. ccmake

  sudo apt-get install ccmake

5. Yaafe
    
- download the archive: http://sourceforge.net/projects/yaafe/files/yaafe-v0.64.tgz/download
- extract the archive
- make sure you have installed all the dependencies listed in the README (more help on that later)
- run the following command into the extracted archive folder:

  $ make build
  $ cd build
  $ ccmake ..

press c
GO down to
WITH_FFTW3 and make it ON (press space)
WITH_MPG123 and make it ON (press space)
press g

  $ make [-j{numberOfCoresOfYourMachine}]
  $ sudo make install

- now yaafe is installed to your machine, we just need to make it accessible to the user
 - sudo chmod 766 /usr/local/bin/yaafe.py [We need to lower permissions here]


### Direct use


1. Loading the constant.csv file from the songs in your server database.

  ./clear_data (-s) -f featureplan

the '-s' option remove the last constants loaded.

2. Ensure that the data were loaded correctly in constant.csv 

3. Analysing the data
  > source('clustering.R')
